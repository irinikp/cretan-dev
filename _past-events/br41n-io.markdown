BR41N.IO is a brainstorming and collaborative marathon designed to be a learning experience for  developers, technologists, 
engineers, students, artists, and scientists who cram and build brain-computer interface (BCI) applications together in teams. 

By putting creative minds from multiple disciplines together for a short period of time, BCI-related applications not 
readily thought of can be discovered and uncovered.

## When 
Monday, October 7, 2019 - Tuesday, October 8, 2019

Out of The Blue Capsis Elite Resort Hotel, Heraklion.
